My Emacs configuration
======================

Rewrite of my old Emacs configuration based on Prelude.

## Installation

**This configuration will not work with upstream Emacs Prelude**, in order to
use it you'll need my version of Emacs Prelude which uses
[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) to manage packages.
